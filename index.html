                        made with Apache Spark as the backbone to handle HTTP requests.
                        I developed the Android client which used Volley in order to send and receive JSON payloads to
                        and from the server to communicate changes in user settings and feed information. I also
                        completely designed the layout. This was my first attempt at using a server in order to get my
                        data for displaying.</p>

                    <p class="baseball-descr">Senior capstone where I worked with one partner. The goal was to find the
                        least amount of statistics necessary to make an accurate simulation.
                        I developed our databases which were SQLite databases due to their portability across platforms
                        and great read performance since reading from them was our main operation.
                        I also created our original object relational mapping scheme.
                        I eventually migrated the project over to Hibernare once it became more optimal not only for
                        performance but also for managing the data as a whole.
                        I also helped develop the code base to drive thee simulations and eventually implemented Maven
                        to help streamline our build process.
